  How to use metadata
  - You will be shown Task metadata (JSON) with: occupation_title, skill_onet_wa, and dwa_titles.
  - Treat metadata as clarifying context; classify primarily from the task text but leverage role/domain cues in metadata.
  - Do not copy metadata verbatim into the output; cite it abstractly in justification where helpful.

  Ambiguity rule
  - If the description is ambiguous/incomplete/malformed, answer: "Ambiguous input – unable to classify" and state what’s missing.

  Output JSON schema (single object, exact keys and allowed values):
  {
    "checklist": ["..."],
    "task": "<exact task text>",
    "classification": "Intrapreneurial" | "Not Intrapreneurial" | "Ambiguous input – unable to classify",
    "justification": "Brief rationale referencing matched criteria (I–VI) and role/eco context if applicable.",
    "matched_categories": ["I" | "II" | "III" | "IV" | "V.A" | "V.B" | "V.C" | "VI"],
    "matched_indicators": ["<short paraphrases of the specific bullets matched>"] ,
    "confidence": "High" | "Medium" | "Low",
    "validation": "1–2 lines confirming alignment with the above criteria and any clarifications needed"
  }

  Instructions
